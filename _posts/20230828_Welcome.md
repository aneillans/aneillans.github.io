Hello again ... I'm going to see if I can use GitHub Pages to throw together a quick site / blog to get thoughts and ideas out there. I never really got anywhere using my own site for it, as I just don't have time for managing the infrastructure along with everything else I do ... but this is super low maintenance for me ... so who knows!
